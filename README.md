The gist of workersâ€™ compensation is as follows: When a worker of a participating company is injured in performance of her/his job, she/he can file a claim for the medical expenses and loss of wages related to theinjury. When a claim is filed for the first time, a unique claim identifier is created and the details of the claims are recorded. The claim details are updated as payments are made to settle the claim.  Payments can be made for various activities relatedto a claim, such as doctor visit, pharmacy, etc.
